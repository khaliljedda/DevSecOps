1) kubectl apply  error : Found character that cannot start any token
    solution : convert tabs to space    cat -T yourfile.yaml | grep "^^I"


2) when I change the version of the mysql Deployment i had the error: 
        RunContainerError, CrashLoopBackOff ou Error
  and if i show the mysql pod logs i get:
       [ERROR] [FATAL] InnoDB: Table flags are 0 in the data dictionary but the flags in file ./ibdata1 are 0x4000!
       [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' init function returned error.
       .
       .
       .
       .
   the problem is the configurations of the other version  are still exist in the persistance volume 
   so you should delete this directory 
   in my case "sudo rm -r /mnt/data"

3) i can't connect to the backend-service:
   problem: because i use the backend service name in my scrip code in the frontend,
            so the the service name will be called from the browser.
            or it this service is not accessible from the outside the cluster.
   
   sollution: create a reverse proxy with nginx
