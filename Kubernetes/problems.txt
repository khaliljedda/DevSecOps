1) kubectl apply  error : Found character that cannot start any token
    solution : convert tabs to space    cat -T yourfile.yaml | grep "^^I"


2) when I change the version of the mysql Deployment i had the error: 
        RunContainerError, CrashLoopBackOff ou Error
  and if i show the mysql pod logs i get:
       [ERROR] [FATAL] InnoDB: Table flags are 0 in the data dictionary but the flags in file ./ibdata1 are 0x4000!
       [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' init function returned error.
       .
       .
       .
       .
   the problem is the configurations of the other version  are still exist in the persistance volume 
   so you should delete this directory 
   in my case "sudo rm -r /mnt/data"

3) i can't connect to the backend-service
   the problem is the targetPort it not the same widh my container port

   solution: I change it
